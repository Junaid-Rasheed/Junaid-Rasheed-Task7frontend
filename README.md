This is the **frontend of the project**! While the primary focus lies in the backend implementation, this frontend complements it by showcasing the results in an intuitive and user-friendly manner.

Utilizing server-side pagination, sorting, and filtration, this frontend ensures efficient data handling even with large datasets. To enhance the visual appeal and user experience, MaterialUI has been employed for styling purposes, providing a sleek and modern interface.

At the bottom of the page, you'll find navigation arrows facilitating pagination actions, allowing you to smoothly navigate through the dataset.

Additionally, near the "Age" column title, you'll notice two arrow icons. These icons enable sorting functionality, allowing you to organize the data based on age, either from youngest to oldest or vice versa.

**To get started with this frontend:**

1. Begin by installing the necessary dependencies using `npm install`.
2. Once the dependencies are installed, launch the project by running `npm start`.

With the frontend up and running, you'll have access to the rich features provided by the backend.
